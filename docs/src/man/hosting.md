# Hosting Documentation

After going through the [Package Guide](@ref) and [Doctests](@ref) page you will need to
host the generated documentation somewhere for potential users to read. This guide will
describe how to setup automatic updates for your package docs using the Travis build service
and GitHub Pages. This is the same approach used by this package to host it's own docs --
the docs you're currently reading.

---

**Notes**

Following this guide should be the *final* step you take after you are comfortable with the
syntax and build process used by `Documenter.jl`. Only proceed with the steps outlined on
this page once you have successfully used `mkdocs` locally to build your documentation.
`mkdocs` can typically be installed using `pip install mkdocs` in your terminal.

This guide assumes that you already have GitHub and Travis accounts setup. If not then go
set those up first and then return here.

---

## Overview

Once setup correctly the following will happen each time you push new updates to your
package repository:

- travis buildbots startup and run your tests;
- each buildbot will build the package docs using your `docs/make.jl` script;
- a single buildbot will then try to push the generated docs back the github.

The following sections outline how to enable this for your own package.

## GitHub Security Key

Firstly, generate a new [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

Enter a description for this new token. We'll be calling ours "Travis", but any other name
will do. For the "Select scopes" option choose "public_repo" **only**. Then generate the
token and save it somewhere safe. We'll be needing it during the next section.

## Travis Environment Settings

Next we'll add the generated token to our repository's Travis page. Go to the settings page
for the repository and under the "Environment Variables" section add a new variable called
`GITHUB_API_KEY`. Copy the generated key from the [GitHub Security Key](@ref) section as
the value and **make sure** that "Display value in build log" is **off**. Be careful to remove any leading white-space from the key. Then add the key.

## `.travis.yml` Configuration

In the `after_success` section of the `.travis.yml` file, where code coverage is processed,
run your `docs/make.jl` file:

```yaml
after_success:
  - julia -e 'Pkg.clone("https://github.com/MichaelHatherly/Documenter.jl")'
  - julia -e 'cd(Pkg.dir("PACKAGE_NAME")); include(joinpath("docs", "make.jl"))'
```

Note that once the package is registered in `METADATA.jl` the `Pkg.clone` call can be
replaced with `Pkg.add("Documenter")`.

## The `deploydocs` Function

At the moment your `docs/make.jl` file probably only contains

```julia
using Documenter, PACKAGE_NAME

makedocs()
```

We'll need to add an additional call to this file after [`makedocs`](@ref). Add the
following at the end of the file:

```julia
deploydocs(
    repo = "github.com/USER_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME.jl.git"
)
```

where `USER_NAME` and `PACKAGE_NAME` must be set to the appropriate names.

By default `deploydocs` will deploy the documentation from the `nightly` Julia build for
Linux. This can be changed using the `julia` and `osname` keywords as follows:

```julia
deploydocs(
    deps   = Deps.pip("mkdocs", "python-markdown-math"),
    repo   = "github.com/USER_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME.jl.git",
    julia  = "0.4",
    osname = "osx"
)
```

This will deploy the docs from the OSX Julia 0.4 Travis build bot.

The keyword `deps` serves to provide the required dependencies to deploy
the documentation. In the example above we include the dependencies
[mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org)
and [`python-markdown-math`](https://github.com/mitya57/python-markdown-math).
The former makes sure that MkDocs is installed to deploy the documentation,
and the latter provides the `mdx_math` markdown extension to exploit MathJax
rendering of latex equations in markdown. Other dependencies should be
included here.

See the [`deploydocs`](@ref) function documentation for more details.

## The MkDocs `mkdocs.yml` File

We'll be using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) to convert the markdown files generated by
Documenter to HTML. (This, of course, is not the only option you have for this step. Any
markdown to HTML converter should work fine with some amount of setting up.)

Add an `mkdocs.yml` file to your `docs/` directory with the following content:

```yaml
site_name:        PACKAGE_NAME.jl
repo_url:         https://github.com/USER_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME.jl
site_description: Description...
site_author:      USER_NAME

theme: readthedocs

extra_css:
  - assets/Documenter.css

extra_javascript:
  - https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML
  - assets/mathjaxhelper.js

markdown_extensions:
  - extra
  - tables
  - fenced_code
  - mdx_math

docs_dir: 'build'

pages:
  - Home: index.md
```

This is only a basic skeleton. Read through the MkDocs documentation if you would like to
know more about the available settings.

## `.gitignore`

Add the following to your package's `.gitignore` file

```
docs/build/
docs/site/
```

These are needed to avoid committing generated content to your repository.

## `gh-pages` Branch

Create a new branch called `gh-pages` and push it to GitHub. If this branch already exists
then you can skip this step, but do note that the generated content is automatically pushed
to this branch from Travis.

## Documentation Versions

When documentation is generated it is stored in one of the following folders:

- `latest` stores the most recent documentation that is committed to the `master` branch.

- `stable` stores the most recent documentation from a tagged commit. Older tagged versions
  are stored in directories named after their tags. These tagged directories are persistent
  and must be manually removed from the `gh-pages` branch if necessary.

Once your documentation has been pushed to the `gh-pages` branch you should add links to
your `README.md` pointing to the `stable` and `latest` documentation URLs. It is common
practice to make use of "badges" similar to those used for Travis and AppVeyor build
statuses or code coverage. Adding the following to your package `README.md` should be all
that is necessary:

```markdown
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-stable-blue.svg)](https://USER_NAME.github.io/PACKAGE_NAME.jl/stable)
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-blue.svg)](https://USER_NAME.github.io/PACKAGE_NAME.jl/latest)
```

`PACKAGE_NAME` and `USER_NAME` should be replaced with their appropriate values. The colour
and text of the image can be changed by altering `docs-stable-blue` as described on
[shields.io](http://shields.io), though it is recommended that package authors follow this
standard to make it easier for potential users to find documentation links across multiple
package README files.

---

**Final Remarks**

That should be all that is needed to enable automatic documentation building. Pushing new
commits to your `master` branch should trigger doc builds. Note that other branches do not
trigger these builds and neither do pull requests by potential contributors.

If you would like to see a more complete example of how this process is setup then take a
look at this package's repository for some inspiration.
